# Project: Neighborhood Map 

Neighborhood Map A single-page application featuring my favourite Lakes in Algonquin Park.  There are map markers for each favourite location, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. 

There is integration with Flickr's photo search that provides additional photos that other users contributed for that location.

## Features and libraries :

Knockout.JS

HTML5

CSS

jQuery (to handle resize of windows, hiding/showing navigation)

Responsive CSS

animations


## Demo

## Instructions
• Unzip the master file and run the index.html in your browser.
• Filter lakes in Algonquin park by clicking on the marker.
• By clicking on the pins or list items, the lake title and photos will be displayed in an InfoWindow.
• There is an event listener which centers the map based on the selected pin so it would help a lot on small displays.
• Highlighting a marker would highlight the sidebar element and vice versa
